# Accessing the mod 
#-----------------------------------
This "mod" adds a few maps. As said before, now you will have access to the dev console with "4" in game.
Here are some useful commands:
Open <mapname>                           This will load a specified map.
ServerTravel <mapname>                   If you are hosting a lobby, this will load a specified map and take everyone in the server with you.

To access the custom maps type this into the console.
Open Advanced_Lighting			This is an experimental map that I test stuff in and make obstacle courses
Open StarterMap				This is a circular map with three floors and a central panopticon
Open Minimal_Default			This is a tropical map with an interactable drawbridge.
Open Vir				This is a Randomizer map that will choose 8 of 16 tiles to use randomly.
Open Blank				This is a collectathon map that keeps track of your total through the server name.
