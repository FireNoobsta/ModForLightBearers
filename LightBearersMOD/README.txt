# Accessing the mod 
#-----------------------------------
This mod adds a few maps. Press "M" to toggle the mod menu.
If you're in game you must pause first to interact with it.
From this menu you can load 6 different custom maps.

Maps:
Experimental			This is an experimental map that I test stuff in and make obstacle courses
Panopticon			This is a circular map with three floors and a central panopticon
Tropical			This is a tropical map with an interactable drawbridge.
Randomizer			This is a Randomizer map that will choose 8 of 16 tiles to use randomly.
Collectathon			This is a collectathon map that keeps track of your total through the server name.
Factory				This is a factory map with conveyor belts that can adjust speed.

There is also a "Spawn Tower Defense" button which is a WIP tower defense mode.
The host of the server can press it while someone is picking shadow to activate it.
Afterwards, the pool will spawn as soon as the round starts and the waves will start in 30 seconds.
The score and wave number will appear on the tab menu where the servername used to be.
Also the life count is displayed as the server time, (Right now you have 4 lives to begin with).
Each wave bear bots will spawn and run towards the pool of light. Your goal is to stop them.
You get 1 point for each tag, and you can use them to buy turrets. Type "/tur" while a game is active in the chat box to place 
a turret where you stand. The price starts at 1 but doubles every time.
If you have 100 or more points, you can type "/gun" in chat for a temporary power where you constantly shoot bursts of snowballs in front of yourself.
This mode is incredibly finnicky and won't work on all maps, but still works even if the host is the only player with the mod.
